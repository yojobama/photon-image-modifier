# Vulkan on the Mali-G610 (RK3588/RK3588S), for PhotonVision's vkapriltag
# detector.
#
# There are two Vulkan stacks available on this SoC and they are NOT
# interchangeable. Measured on an Orange Pi 5 Plus, same binary, same
# 1280x800 tag36h11 image, decimation 1:
#
#   Mesa PanVK on the upstream panthor kernel driver ... 141 ms/frame
#   ARM libmali on the vendor kbase driver ............   11 ms/frame
#   CPU libapriltag detector (for reference) ..........   43 ms/frame
#
# PanVK is not merely slower, it is slower than not using the GPU at all, so
# an image built on it makes vkapriltag pointless. The gap is driver-side,
# not algorithmic: the worst single compute shader runs 78x slower under
# PanVK (91.8 ms vs 1.18 ms) and the adaptive-threshold pass 11.5x slower.
# PanVK additionally reports no host-cached memory types and no timestamp
# queries. With libmali, vkapriltag is ~4x faster than the CPU detector.
#
# Consequently this deliberately does NOT enable the panthor-gpu device-tree
# overlay. panthor and the vendor kbase driver are mutually exclusive, and
# binding the GPU to panthor is exactly what makes libmali unusable (no
# /dev/mali0). kbase needs no overlay here - it is already builtin in the
# Armbian vendor kernel (CONFIG_MALI_MIDGARD=y).
#
# g24p0, not g13p0: only the g24p0 blob ships a Vulkan ICD
# (libMaliVulkan.so.1 plus /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/mali.json). g13p0 is
# GLES/EGL/OpenCL only and silently leaves Vulkan with no driver at all.
#
# libvulkan1 is still required - it is the Vulkan *loader*, which is separate
# from the ICD libmali provides. mesa-vulkan-drivers is deliberately not
# installed: its panfrost and lavapipe ICDs would enumerate alongside
# libmali's and can be selected instead of it.
# curl is not in the Armbian minimal base image, and this script runs before
# install_common.sh, so it cannot be assumed present.
